# Research Notes

Findings from the reference projects and from analysis of the GOG executable. Each item is marked
**Confirmed** (checked against the GOG build statically and/or live), **Hypothesis** (sourced but not yet
verified on this build), or **Refuted** (contradicted by observation).

Research date: 2026-10-12. No third-party code was copied into Lockpick.

## 0. Areas, rooms and routes

- **Stage areas** (deserteagle417's "Autosplitter Room ID Maps", speedrun.com resources; floor plans with room numbers,
  no names, no license — not committed): stage index 0 = mansion 1F (rooms 1xx), 1 = mansion 2F (2xx),
  2 = courtyard & underground (3xx), 3 = guardhouse (4xx), 4 = laboratory (5xx), 5/6 = mansion 1F/2F on the return
  (6xx/7xx). The plans agree with the door links in `room-index.json` (e.g. 2F room 2, the balcony around the dining
  room, is where the statue falls from). `data/games/re1/rooms.json` holds the areas, and names only for rooms whose
  identity live captures or the player confirmed.
- **Key-item routes** (owner-supplied split package, July 2024: RE1aio.asl + LiveSplit files): Jill and Chris Any% NMG
  split on each key item in route order — Jill: Emblem, Chemical, Armor Key, Music Notes, Gold Emblem, Blue Jewel,
  Shield Key, Wind Crest, Serum, Moon/Sun/Star Crests, Square Crank, Control Room Key, Red Book, 002/003 Keys, Helmet
  Key, Doom Books, Batteries, Hex Crank, Power Room Key, Master Key, Flare, End (the Jill file carries a 49:01 personal
  best with per-segment times). Facts used as leads for route guidance and autosplits; the files and their icons are
  not included. The autosplitter also gives `characterID` 0xBE9829 (verified in saves), previous room 0xAC9CF4 and a
  new-game byte 0xC26E2F (unverified).
- **Speedrun segments** (LiveSplit templates from speedrun.com, no times): Chris/Jill × good/bad ending × MG/NMG share
  Yawn 1 › Mansion 1 › Courtyard 1 › Boxes › Guardhouse › Courtyard 2 › Yawn 2 › Basement › Mansion 2 › Courtyard 3 ›
  Black Tiger › Underground › Loud Room › (Lab) Tyrant › [Orgy Room, good ending] › End; the first split is
  "King Henry" (Jill NMG), "Rebecca Piano" (Chris NMG) or "Chemical Skip" (MG). A lead for route/split features (0.8+).

## 0a. Voice and video

`USA\Voice` holds the English voice-over as 563 plain WAV files (40.7 min, 22 kHz mono 16-bit; two 44.1 kHz stereo),
named `vSSS_LL.wav` (31 groups; the group looks like a story scene, LL a line, hex). `USA\Movie` holds 27 AVI videos
(Capcom logo, intro, endings). Only one room script plays a voice directly (`xa_on` in 704); cutscene voices come from
the event scripts (`offsets[8]`, not parsed yet) — or can be identified in captures if the playing sound shows in the
system block's 0x24-stride arrays. Transcribed 2026-10-13 (`tools/voice/`: Whisper large-v3 greedy + beam search with
character names as a prompt, NVIDIA Canary-Qwen 2.5B under WSL, merged by `compare.py`): 540 dialogue lines on which
at least two passes agree, 9 screams, the rest without speech (the `vb00_*` sounds and all 27 videos). Canary
misspells names (Whisker, Jail) but returns nothing on silence where Whisper invents text — together they catch
both failure modes. The dialogue is Capcom's, so it is never committed here: the subtitles are published separately as
[lockpick-subtitles](https://github.com/mscrnt/lockpick-subtitles) (fan transcription for accessibility, no license
granted, removed on request) by `tools/voice/export_pack.py`; CI rejects audio/video files in this repository.

## 0b. Room files (RDT) — what each game flag means

The game's room files (`USA\Stage1..7\ROOMsrrv.RDT`, s = stage, rr = room, v = 0 Chris / 1 Jill) contain init and
main scripts with `item_aot_set` (item id, quantity, pickup flag), `em_set` (enemy type, kill flag) and
`door_aot_set` (target room, lock flag, key item) opcodes. `tools/rdt/rdt_index.py` walks every retail room file
(320 files, no desync) and writes `data/games/re1/room-index.json` — ids and flag numbers only.

**Confirmed (live, 2026-10-13):** flag *n* of a bank is bit `31 − n % 32` of word `n / 32` (bit 31 of the first word
is flag 0). The ITEM group is the `flagRoomItems` bank (a set bit = still in the world), ENEMY is `flagEnemies`
(set = killed), LOCK is `flagLocks` (set = unlocked). Checked against captures: blue jewel flag 44, 1F map 145, wind
crest 174, the two dogs in 108 (0, 1), the door 206→207 (lock 21), the document in 206 (247).

## 1. Identifying the running game

- **Confirmed:** GOG installs register under `HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\GOG.com\Games\1580232252`
  (`path`, `exe`, `ver` = "1.0 hotfix4"). Executable `ResidentEvil.exe`, 32-bit, no ASLR.
- **Confirmed:** The autosplitter identifies builds by `ModuleMemorySize` (EnglishGOG = 77279232 /
  `0x49B3000`). This GOG revision's SizeOfImage is `0x49B2000`, so that check fails on it — an earlier
  GOG revision existed. Lockpick identifies by SHA-256 instead.
- **Confirmed:** GOG ships its own DirectDraw wrapper (`ddraw.dll`, "GOG.com DirectX 1-7 wrapper"
  v1.1.0.5574, configured by `dxcfg.ini`) and input wrapper (`dinput.dll`). Classic REbirth is not present.
- **Confirmed:** When the GOG installer launches the game it runs elevated; a non-elevated Lockpick then
  gets `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED` for `PROCESS_VM_READ`. Lockpick reports this explicitly.
- **Confirmed:** The game is single-instance; a second launch exits immediately.

## 1a. Versions runners use, and Classic REbirth (2026-10-17)

- **Confirmed (speedrun.com API, game `residentevil`):** the PC board recommends the Japanese MediaKite version (or a
  reprint) with Classic REbirth (or the 1.7/1.8 patch); GOG and Steam are allowed and may use REbirth. LiveSplit's IGT
  script must be shown. Banned: REbirth's debug menu, quickturn and tactical reload; mods; tabbing out. Separate boards:
  EMU (DuckStation with fixed settings, or PSXjin / BizHawk; Director's Cut non-DualShock is the fast version), PlayStation,
  PSN, Saturn (real hardware), plus `re1ce` (extensions) and `re123`.
- **Confirmed (LiveSplit.AutoSplitters.xml):** the only RE1 autosplitter is deserteagle417's `RE1aio.asl`; PC only
  (JapaneseREbirth 10027008, JapaneseGOG 77144064, EnglishGOG 77279232 by ModuleMemorySize). GOG hotfix4's SizeOfImage
  is 77275136 (`0x49B2000`), so the script's English GOG check doesn't match this build.
- **Confirmed (classicrebirth.com, files downloaded 2026-10-17):** REbirth's install is the official 1.01 `Biohazard.exe`
  (962,560 bytes) plus its `ddraw.dll` (1.1.4 also `SDL3.dll`, `gamecontrollerdb.txt`, and a Steam launcher,
  `4249100_Launcher.exe`, with the game in `japanese\`). Its DLL holds the size `0xEB000` and SizeOfImage `0x990000` of the
  1.01 exe and none of the GOG English exe's values. Version table in 1.1.4: European 1.00c, Japanese 1.01, Asia 1.00,
  UK/USA 1.00 (+alt), German, French, PowerVR UK/US and Japanese 1.00, PC Gamer demo.
- **Confirmed (strings in REbirth's DLL):** `config.ini` beside the game, `[RE1]` (… `Save_folder = %s`, default
  `savedata`) and `[DLL]` (`QuickTurn`, `TactReload`, `CutSkip`, `FocusIgnore`, `EnableDebug`, `BootConfig`, `Steam`, …),
  `[Mods]` / `[Mod_Preset_n]`; mods are `mod_*` folders. Saves: `<save folder>\savedatN.dat`.

## 2. Accessing memory

- **Confirmed:** All relevant state is in static globals of the main image (no pointer chains needed for
  0.1). Absolute addresses are stable because the image is not relocatable.
- Autosplitter offsets are module-relative (`0x400000 +`). The decomp lists absolute addresses.

## 3. Player and enemy structures

- **Confirmed (live):** HP i16 at player+0x88 (`0xBE636C`), max HP u8 at +0x175, position int32 at
  +0x34/+0x3C, character at +0x01 (Chris = 0).
- **Confirmed (live):** Jill = 1 with max HP 96 (decomp: `maxHealth = (id & 1) * -44 + 140`); a Jill game sets
  `stateFlags & 0x00800000`. **Hypothesis:** Rebecca = 3.
- **Hypothesis:** Enemy array of 30 × 0x18C at `0xBE6464` (decomp; the Mod SDK declares 32 but the USA
  code clamps to 30). The autosplitter's EnglishGOG enemy addresses are JP values copied unchanged and are
  wrong for GOG (no code references).

## 4. Room and camera

- **Confirmed (static + live):** stage/room/camera bytes at `0xBE9820/21/22`, derived from the RDT and
  background filename builders (see MEMORY_MAP.md). Room files: `USA\StageN\ROOMsRRp.RDT`, `p` = 0 Chris / 1 Jill.
- **Confirmed (live):** at a door the room id changes first; the camera id keeps the previous room's
  value for several seconds (4.7 s at 106→105; ~17 s at 105→104 during the Kenneth cutscene) while the
  game timer is frozen.

## 5. RDT files (for 0.4)

From biorand / biohazard-utils (MIT), not yet verified against the USA files:
header bytes `nSprite, nCut, nOmodel, nItem, nDoor, nRoom_at`; 19 int32 offsets at `0x48`
(cameras, collision, models, init/main/event SCD, messages, …); camera array at `0x94`.
SCD opcodes: `0x0C door_aot_set` (26 bytes; target = stage<<5 | room), `0x18 item_aot_set` (26 bytes),
`0x1B` enemy set (22 bytes). Some stage-1 rooms are read from stage+5 (`MissingRooms`).

## 6. Overlays / HUD

- REbirth mods draw in-process through the REbirth SDK. Not applicable to GOG. The GOG wrapper renders via
  Direct3D 9; an external transparent window is the planned first approach (0.3).
- **Confirmed (user report):** the game stops rendering (black) when it loses focus — a property of the
  original window procedure; fixing it needs an in-process patch.

## 7. Gameplay events

- **Refuted:** "`stateFlags & 0x02000000` = gameplay active" (decomp `g_main_state_flags`). Live: set only
  for single polls at New Game and during door transitions; clear during all free movement.
- **Confirmed (live):** `mainMenu` (`0xD22777`) is 1 at the title menu (also after dying) and 0 in game
  (autosplitter uses it for reset).
- **Confirmed (live):** `stateFlags & 0x01000000` set at death; HP overshoots below zero (−10).
- **Confirmed (live):** after death, choosing New Game keeps the dead game's room/HP in memory through
  character select and the intro (~23 s) until the new game initializes.
- **Confirmed (live):** loading a save from the title: `mainMenu` 1 → 0 on entering the load screen, then the
  timer jumps to the save's value (backwards, `0x64AE → 0x6253`), the position resets to the saved spot and the
  timer resumes. During the load-file screen (~7 s) the previous game's values remain in memory with
  `mainMenu == 0`, so they briefly count as "in game".
- **Confirmed (live, 2026-10-13):** attract mode (title screen left idle) replays the same demo each cycle on this
  build: Chris in room 107 with a preset 8-slot inventory and item box, `mainMenu = 0`, max HP 140 but **HP 0**.
  The session rule (`hp > 0`) therefore treats demos as "not in game", so they produce no state or events.
- **Confirmed (live, 2026-10-13):** in **Jill's** game, saving at a typewriter on the GOG PC build consumed **no ink
  ribbons** (owner saved three times with no ribbon in the inventory and no quantity change; `SAVE\savedat1–3.dat`
  were written at the save times). **Chris's** game uses them: each of his saves consumed one ink ribbon (id `0x2F`,
  BioRand id 47) — ribbon use depends on the scenario, not the platform. During a save the in-game timer freezes (~7 s) and no profile field or state-flag bit changes,
  so saves are detected from the save files, not memory.
- **From the leaderboard's rules (speedrun.com, read 2026-10-16):** opening the options menu pauses the in-game timer
  (the PC rules forbid it as a pause for that reason). One answer for B206; the status screen, files, doors,
  cutscenes and the item box are still to be measured.
- **Refuted for this build:** the autosplitter's `time` (`0x4D46D4`) is not the live timer — it is a
  copy written at one code site (`0x4298AB`). The live timer is `0xD22730`.

## 8. Pickups and interactables

- **Confirmed (static):** inventory at `0xBE9944`, 2 bytes per slot (`mov byte [eax+0xBE9944], id` /
  `mov byte [eax+0xBE9945], 1`). Item ids (biorand, matches autosplitter lists): 0 none, 1 knife,
  2 Beretta, 3 shotgun, … 47 ink ribbon, 61 small key, 66 serum, 67–75 herbs, 0x6F Uzi, 0x70 minigun.
- Room items come from RDT `item_aot_set`; per-room pickup flags live in a flag bank at `0xBE989C` (hypothesis).

## Methods

- Static analysis: Python + Capstone linear sweep over `.text`, searching absolute operands, plus string
  cross-references (`./usa/stage /room    .rdt`, `rcSRRC.pak`, `savedat%d.dat`). Scripts were run on the
  local install only; nothing from the game is committed.
- Runtime: `lockpick-probe trace` (read-only) during normal play. Raw traces are kept next to fixtures.

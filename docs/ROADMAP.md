# Lockpick Roadmap

Each release must be functional, tested and a meaningful improvement. A release is **not** advanced
because its code compiles: game-specific acceptance criteria require validation against the real GOG
executable, and unverified work stays marked as such.

Status legend: ✅ done and verified · 🟡 done, partially verified · ⬜ not started · ⛔ blocked

| 0.1.2 | In-app credits, capture bounties, community setup | ✅ released 2026-10-13 (first update path 0.1.1 → 0.1.2) |
| 0.1.3 | Bounty automation, capture fixes from live testing (compact recordings, mid-session start) | ✅ released 2026-10-13 |
| 0.1.4 | Captures record the game-state memory; enemy and flag detection; grouped reads | ✅ released 2026-10-13 |

| 0.2.0 | Core trainer (Trainer Mode, HP/ammo/inventory, hotkeys), Challenges tab, API for other tools, branding | ✅ released 2026-10-15 |
| 0.3.0 | Play and stream with one app: overlay, runs (timer, splits, LiveSplit), OBS sources, training captures | ⬜ next — responsive UI and display research done |
| 0.4.0 | Room, camera, item and enemy database | ⬜ |
| 0.5.0 | Object highlighting and ESP | ⬜ |
| 0.6.0 | Advanced trainer and gameplay manipulation | ⬜ |
| 0.7.0 | Contextual warnings and route guidance | ⬜ |
| 0.8.0 | Speedrun suite: PB tracking, run review, community segment templates | ⬜ |
| 0.9.0 | Optional AI, optimization, compatibility testing | ⬜ |
| 1.0.0 | Stable RE1 release | ⬜ |

Game-specific work depends on live captures; what each release still needs captured is tracked in
[CAPTURE_BOUNTIES.md](CAPTURE_BOUNTIES.md).

RE2 and RE3 adapters are deliberately out of scope until RE1 reaches 1.0, but the adapter contract
(`IGameAdapter`, profile JSON) is designed so they can be added without restructuring.

## 0.1.0 — Foundation (done)

Goal: identify Resident Evil 1 (GOG), attach safely and read-only, expose live verified game state.

### Definition of done

| # | Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | The application builds successfully | ✅ | `dotnet build -c Release` with warnings-as-errors; CI workflow `ci.yml` |
| 2 | The desktop interface launches | ✅ | Launched and screenshotted on the dev machine (wide and portrait layouts) |
| 3 | Game detection works | ✅ | Running `ResidentEvil.exe` found by name and full path; GOG install located via registry |
| 4 | Executable fingerprinting works | ✅ | SHA-256 + PE header of the real GOG exe matched profile `re1-gog-usa-hotfix4` |
| 5 | Process attachment is safe | ✅ | Read-only handle (`PROCESS_VM_READ`, query, synchronize); in-memory PE header and 9 code anchors verified before any read; reads confined to the image range |
| 6 | Verified memory values are readable and correctly displayed | ✅ | Stage, room, camera, HP, max HP, character, timer, position, main-menu flag observed live in Chris and Jill games (Jill: id 1, max HP 96, Jill RDT bit). Rebecca live 2026-10-15 (B007: id 3, max HP 88, inventory pointer 0xBE9950, shown as Rebecca 88/88 by the probe). |
| 7 | Game-state changes update the interface | ✅ | Live: camera cuts, door transitions, damage, death, return to title, restart |
| 8 | The application safely handles game termination | ✅ | Live: game closed → `Detached: Game process exited`; relaunch → re-attached automatically |
| 9 | Unsupported builds are rejected | ✅ | Hash mismatch never opens the process (unit tests); elevated game reports a clear access message (observed live) |
| 10 | Mock adapter tests pass | ✅ | 70+ tests incl. mock adapter, fake memory, live-trace fixture playback, Win32 integration |
| 11 | Known limitations are documented | ✅ | README, COMPATIBILITY, this file |

**Release decision:** all criteria met; tagged `v0.1.0` on 2026-10-12 after a live Jill session confirmed
character id 1, max HP 96 and the Jill RDT bit.

### Follow-ups (0.1.x, non-blocking)

- [x] Live-verify Jill (character id 1, max HP 96, Jill RDT bit).
- [x] Live-verify the Rebecca partner swap (character id 3) — 2026-10-15, B007 (from a Chris save at Plant 42).
- [x] Live-verify loading a save from the title screen (session rule holds; see RESEARCH.md §7).
- [x] Push to GitHub so `release.yml` publishes the tagged build (0.1.0–0.1.5 published by `release.yml`).
- [x] All 0.1.x capture bounties done (B001–B008; the last, Rebecca, 2026-10-15).

---

## 0.1.5 — Research tooling (released)

Built and used in live sessions 6–8 (2026-10-13); see CHANGELOG `[0.1.5]`.

- Capture markers: Ctrl+Shift+M (configurable) or the Debug page; notes saved in the capture.
- Ask mode: pauses the game and asks about events Lockpick can't explain; predicts rooms, maps, documents,
  room-script events and action-driven events, so it asks only about cutscenes, surprises and switch puzzles
  (session 8: 10 questions in ~90 minutes). ~85 story/puzzle events named so far (`data/games/re1/flag-labels.json`).
- Room index from the game's room files (`tools/rdt`): items, enemies, doors and story flags per room — the core of
  the 0.4.0 world database, as a research tool.
- Capture timeline (`tools/bounties/timeline.py`): rooms, pickups, documents, kills, attacks by name, pushes, item
  use, saves, markers and answers.
- Voice-over transcription (`tools/voice`) and the separate subtitles pack (data for 0.3.0).

---

## 0.1.6 — Progress tracker (released)

Pulled forward from 0.7.0 (owner's decision, 2026-10-13): read-only and Challenge-safe, and it needs no new memory
research — the room index, the flag banks and the named flags already hold everything.

Acceptance criteria:
- A Progress page: per area and per room, the items still there vs taken (room index + pickup flags), documents and
  maps collected, rooms explored (the map's own flags, all five stages), enemies killed for good (kill flags).
- Story progress from the named flags (what has happened, in game order), unnamed flags shown as "unnamed event".
- Character-aware (Jill's and Chris's room files differ) and correct for the mansion revisited (6xx/7xx).
- Updates live while playing; works from a loaded save (flags, not history).
- Verified live against a playthrough: counts match what the player saw; no writes, no extra process access.

**Live check 2026-10-15** (the owner's saves loaded from the title screen: Jill in the mansion revisited, 66 rooms
explored; Chris in the main hall): every area's items, documents and maps, rooms and kills matched an independent
reading of the same state (`tools/bounties/progress_preview.py` on a capture), and so did the story list (61 named,
11 unnamed). The page updated live when Jill entered a new room (courtyard rooms explored 4 → 5) and re-attached after
the game restarted. Found and fixed: items a story event places later counted as taken before their room was visited.
Read-only throughout (the app's handle has no write rights).

---

## 0.2.0 — Core trainer (released 2026-10-15)

Goal: deliberate, validated memory modification in Trainer Mode, with Challenge Mode enforcing no writes.

Status (2026-10-15): every criterion below is built and live-verified on the GOG build (issues #8–#12, #14, #16,
#17, #37), on top of the 0.2.0 capture bounties (B101–B114). The app also gained the Challenges tab (guided
challenges that fail on a hit or a non-knife shot), an API for other tools, branding, and layouts for wide,
ultrawide and portrait windows. The save tools moved to 0.6.0.

Acceptance criteria:
- **Done:** separate write-capable handle requested only when Trainer Mode is enabled (`PROCESS_VM_WRITE | PROCESS_VM_OPERATION`); Challenge Mode never opens one (live: the handle closes when a challenge starts).
- **Done:** every write goes through a typed, profile-declared writable field with bounds (e.g. HP 1..maxHp) and is read back to confirm.
- **Done:** trainer action log (persisted, `trainer/actions.jsonl`) with timestamp, field, old → new value and source.
- **Done (live 2026-10-15):** set/lock HP, infinite ammo, inventory editor — counts of what you carry, and any item
  put into the item box (the game loads it like a pickup when taken out; box entries 0–47 runtime-verified). Background
  for the design: inventory slots (8 slots, id + quantity at `0xBE9944`; the held-item count
  `0xBE9827` must follow, and grid icons load only on pickup, load, combine or an item-box swap — MEMORY_MAP).
  **Done (read side), 2026-10-14:** the Items page shows the inventory grid (8 or 6 slots, equipped weapon) and the
  item box (48 entries at `0xBE98E4`, runtime-verified).
- **Done 2026-10-14:** item id table (from biorand, MIT, with attribution) checked against the game's own item-name
  table for ids 1–77 (`data/games/re1/names.json`; mismatches corrected, generic names before examining noted).
- **Done (owner-verified live 2026-10-15):** hotkeys (global, configurable: fill HP, lock HP, infinite ammo) with no
  effect unless Trainer Mode has write access; also a GameSaved event from the save folder (#37, owner save to slot 4).
- **Done:** run record notes whether any write occurred (`RunInvalidated` event; a challenge fails if cheats go on).
- **Done:** all writable addresses runtime-verified on the GOG build; tests with fake memory for every write path.
- Moved to 0.6.0 (2026-10-15): the save tools (practice mode, save editor).

## 0.3.0 — Play and stream with one app

Owner's direction (2026-10-15): the first release for other players. A runner doing a speedrun, a no-damage run, a
knife-only run or a regular playthrough needs only Lockpick open — no second app for timing, splits or the stream —
and their sessions can be captured for behaviour-cloning research (they will be playing 0.3.0, so training captures
ship in it).

**What we know going in (2026-10-15):**
- Display research ([DISPLAY.md](DISPLAY.md)): Lockpick reads the game in every display mode; the game is
  per-monitor DPI aware and opens on the primary monitor; windowed/borderless overlays work and never take focus;
  exclusive fullscreen minimizes and stops on any focus change (an overlay there still needs an owner check); a
  vanilla game pauses and goes black when inactive, which blanks every OBS capture; Discord's toast covers the
  top-left corner.
- OBS 32.2.2 / WebSocket 5.7.4 on the owner's PC supports everything planned below (browser sources, recording,
  `CreateRecordChapter`, `SaveReplayBuffer`, scene and source switching, creating inputs).
- Already in the app: challenges (no damage, knife only, speedrun) with live rule checks, the API with a live event
  stream (`/api/v1/events/stream`), controller markers, captures, the room map, progress and the layouts.
- speedrun.com's PC rules (checked 2026-10-15 through its API): runs are timed by **in-game time**, start at the
  title screen and end on the end screen showing the final IGT; the options menu pauses IGT (so using it as a pause
  is banned); **tabbing out or clicking off the game is not allowed during a run**; no mods; LiveSplit with its IGT
  script must be used and IGT shown (autosplits optional). Categories: Jill / Chris, Bad / Best ending, No Major /
  Major Glitches, No Restriction / **Knife Only**.
- OBS's browser source exposes `window.obsstudio` (obs-browser 2.26.9 in OBS 32.2.2, verified 2026-10-15): a page
  with `webpage_control_level` 4 read the status and current scene, got scene-change events and a live event
  stream; level 4 allows switching scenes and saving the replay buffer, 5 starting/stopping recording.
- Known in memory: in-game clock `0xD22730` (frames at 30/s; zeroed on New Game, restored on load — the docs disagree
  whether it runs in menus: bounty B206), player dead (`0x01000000` in the state flags, HP below 0), the results
  screen (reads the saved clock), named story flags, item pickups and rooms (split triggers), the input words
  `0xBE9840`/`0xBE9842` and the raw pad word `0xBF0A04`.

**Owner decisions (2026-10-15):** challenges are made for streaming and recording — nothing during a run needs a
click outside the game (speedrun.com bans it anyway): hotkeys and the controller for Lockpick, OBS reacting by
itself through an **OBS script shipped with Lockpick**; the timer defaults to the game's clock (matches
speedrun.com); Lockpick may switch the game to borderless by editing `dxcfg.ini` on the player's click; code signing
is decided later. Keep-running stays out of challenges (it patches the game, and runners can't click off anyway).

**Sprints.** 0.3.0 ships after sprints 1–6; the keep-running option and OBS WebSocket control follow as 0.3.1.

1. **Responsive app — done 2026-10-15:** every page at ultrawide (full, half, third, quarter), 1080p, 720p, 1024×768,
   800×600, portrait (720×1280 at 150 %) and the 150 % 1080p monitor (full to quarter); content scrolls instead of
   clipping; the map keeps the space. **Pages in sections (owner, 2026-10-16: the pages were getting cluttered):** each page's sections
   under it in the navigation, one shown at a time (a row above the page in the compact layout).
2. **Overlay** (spec: DISPLAY.md requirements). **Foundation done 2026-10-15 (#54):** follows the game window
   (100 % and 150 % monitors, moved, minimized), sits on the 4:3 picture from `dxcfg.ini`, click-through and
   never activated (verified: a click on the panel reaches the game, the game keeps focus), directly above the game
   (other windows cover it), owner-verified on the 150 % monitor and over exclusive fullscreen (B202); drawn by a
   plain layered window the size of the panel; widgets: in-game time, HP bar, room, challenge state (clean / failed
   with the reason); corner setting.
   Show/hide hotkey (Settings → Hotkeys). Frame pacing measured: the game's clock ran 30.25 ticks/s with the
   overlay up and with Lockpick closed (no cost). **Widgets and the map done 2026-10-15:** each widget is its own
   layered window with its own corner (or off); widgets sharing a corner stack. The map widget is a framed,
   north-up minimap around the player; its hotkey cycles through the views the player ticks (minimap, the whole room
   over the picture on a dark backdrop, the same see-through, hidden), with the minimap's reach and size, the
   see-through strength and names on the full-screen map as options; the time panel stays above a full-screen map
   (verified live in 105). **Floor map done 2026-10-16:** rooms placed from their doors (FloorLayout, the
   tools/rdt/floor_map.py method: door zone centre = arrival spot, least squares), on the Map page with pan and zoom
   and as overlay views (whole floor, see-through; a zoom key follows the player); stage 1 checked by eye against
   the game's own layout. HP band, poison and enemy HP done (#42). Event feed (#43) first pass done: the change
   explainer's plain words in the event log and an overlay widget (attackers by name and zombies getting back up
   still to come). Big messages (#59, first part): challenge failed with the reason, a death, a run finished or a
   new personal best, centred at the top. **Layout editor done 2026-10-16 (#55):** drag widgets on a preview of the
   picture to any spot (kept as a share of the picture); the overlay and the preview place widgets with the same
   code. Lockpick no longer takes the focus over exclusive fullscreen (the ask-mode question shows without it).
   - **Leaderboard runs — done 2026-10-16:** trainer locked read-only, ask mode off, the install hashed against
     GOG's release (no mods), the rules only the player can keep as reminders, the result on each attempt's record;
   - **Widgets off the game too — done 2026-10-16** (owner: the overlays start to cover the picture): one splits
     widget, drawn by livesplit-core (LiveSplit's look) with the world record, instead of two; every widget also as
     a **pop-out window** (movable, resizable, on any monitor, plain or green background for OBS's window capture,
     always on top if wanted, place and open state remembered) and on a **Stream page** in the app — a dashboard of
     the widgets the player picks, sizes and orders; the overlay, pop-outs and Stream page all draw the same widgets
     (one renderer), so each can be used alone. Checked in a replay: map, splits and status in pop-outs and tiles,
     reopened after a restart;
   - follow the game window (PID → class `RESIDENT EVIL`): client rectangle in physical pixels, monitor, DPI,
     minimized, exclusive fullscreen; move/size events;
   - a click-through, topmost, non-activating overlay window over the 4:3 picture (computed from `dxcfg.ini`'s
     `aspect`/`scaling`); hidden while the game is minimized; Lockpick never activates its own windows while the
     game is exclusive fullscreen (the ask-mode question waits or shows without activation);
   - widgets: run timer, splits, HP band and poison, challenge status (a fail banner with the reason), room name,
     enemy HP, the event feed (#43); positioned against the picture, presets for each corner (not top-left by
     default), a layout editor on a preview, toggled by a hotkey or a controller button;
   - exclusive fullscreen: works (owner-verified 2026-10-15 at desktop resolution);
   - game display helper (#20) — **done 2026-10-15:** Settings → Game display: windowed / borderless / fullscreen,
     resolution (the main monitor's own list), picture scaling, vsync, gamma, filtering, antialiasing (every dxcfg
     option, values as GOG's dxcfg.exe writes them); a two-click Restart Resident Evil next to Apply; `dxcfg.ini`
     written only on Apply, the original kept
     in Lockpick's data folder and restorable; a warning when fullscreen would change the monitor's resolution; move
     the game window to another monitor (verified live both ways);
   - budget: the overlay costs < 2 % of the game's frame pacing (measured from the in-game clock).
3. **Runs:** **First pass done 2026-10-16 (#56, #57; docs/RUNS.md):** run sessions (new game → ending, death, title,
   game closed, reset; optional start on a save load), in-game time from the game's clock and real time, split
   triggers (room from a room or another stage, item obtained, the ending, split key), the community's 8 segment
   sets and 2 key-item routes built in (unverified: B701/B702/B703), `.lss` import (triggers matched by name against
   the best-fitting built-in set) and export with the player's times and history, records per attempt, PB and best
   segments, a Runs page, run hotkeys and a splits overlay widget — live: a new Jill game started an attempt, the
   Emblem split at 14.9 s, reset kept the record. **Then:** the run API and OBS splits page (#60), LiveSplit
   follow and drive modes over LiveSplit's TCP server (#58; tested against a stand-in server, LiveSplit itself is
   B208). **Split editor, runs from a save at a chosen split, the wrong-splits warning — done 2026-10-16.** Next: `.lss` import of the community files checked by a player.
   - run sessions: start on New Game (or a loaded save, marked as such), end on the ending's results screen
     (B703), a death / Game Over (B205), quitting to the title, or the game closing; a local record per attempt
     (category, character, in-game time, splits, deaths, damage taken, result, whether cheats were on);
   - a "Playthrough" mode (no rules: timer, splits and progress only) next to the challenges;
   - timer from the game's own clock (the speedrun.com timing; how it behaves in menus — B206), real time as an
     option; a run starts at the title screen, as on the leaderboard;
   - splits: built-in RE1 sets — the community segments (Yawn 1 › Mansion 1 › … › End) and the key-item routes
     (Jill / Chris NMG) — triggered by named story flags, item pickups and rooms (B701, B702, B706); a split editor;
     comparison against the player's best (local);
   - challenge feedback: the fail reason in the overlay and an optional sound; a death counter; retry from a
     controller button — **done 2026-10-16 (#59)**, owner-tested live: no-damage fails on the first hit, the
     death counter, the fail message and the sound (a death doesn't end a speedrun challenge, the owner's call);
     sounds from Windows or the player's own .wav, one for a fail and one for a death;
   - **LiveSplit:** leaderboard runs must use LiveSplit's own IGT script, so by default Lockpick *follows* the
     runner's LiveSplit through LiveSplit Server (split index, times — for the overlay, markers and run records)
     and never splits twice; only with no autosplitter does Lockpick drive it (start, split, reset, set game
     time). Import a `.lss` file's segment names onto Lockpick's split triggers; a capture marker at each split
     (B208);
   - nothing during a run needs a click: retry, marker and overlay toggle from hotkeys or the controller; Lockpick
     shows no dialogs and never takes focus while a run is on (update prompts wait).
   - **Speedrun suite — Lockpick as the one stop from practice to submission** (owner's direction 2026-10-16):
     1. *speedrun.com* — **leaderboard and account done 2026-10-16** (board per split set, WR / top / your place,
        the API key kept with DPAPI and only sent to speedrun.com); **submission done 2026-10-16** (a finished clean
        attempt, board, IGT, date, video, the summary as comment; two presses; tested against a stand-in — the first
        real submission is the owner's). Next: splits.io upload with a submission.
     2. *livesplit-core* — **done 2026-10-16 (ADR-019, docs/LIVESPLIT_CORE.md):** built from a pinned submodule
        with Rust (6.3 MB), following Lockpick's run, kept as a LiveSplit file per split set, drawn as an overlay
        widget and an OBS page; CI builds it. **Comparisons done 2026-10-16:** LiveSplit's comparisons on the Runs
        page, the overlay and its layout; where the PB loses time against the best segments; practice and trainer
        attempts kept out of its history. Next: saving through it.
     3. *An RE1 autosplitter in livesplit-core's WebAssembly format* from Lockpick's verified addresses, run by
        Lockpick and offered to the community (LiveSplit loads it too) — alongside the community `.asl`.
     4. *Managed LiveSplit* for leaderboard runs (the rules require LiveSplit's `.asl` IGT script): Lockpick finds
        or (on request) downloads LiveSplit, starts its server, follows it, and matches its splits by
        `getcategoryname` / `getsplitname`.
     5. *LiveSplit One* driven by Lockpick through its server protocol (a WebSocket on Lockpick's API) for a
        browser or OBS timer with LiveSplit's look.
     6. *Training*: practice from saves (segment practice with per-segment bests), where time was lost per segment,
        the floor map and feed, captures; splits uploaded to splits.io with a submission.
4. **OBS (stream- and record-friendly challenges):** **Done 2026-10-16 except a check in OBS itself (#60, #66):**
   every widget as a browser source with Copy OBS link buttons (Stream → OBS), pop-out windows for Window Capture,
   and `lockpick.lua` (below).
   - the API serves browser-source pages — timer, splits, HP, challenge status, event feed, room map —
     transparent, live through the event stream, options in the URL; "Copy OBS link" buttons; a pop-out HUD
     window for window capture; our in-game overlay is not part of any capture, so these pages are the stream's
     HUD;
   - **`lockpick.lua`, an OBS script shipped with Lockpick — written 2026-10-16 (#66; checked against a stand-in for
     OBS's Lua API, not yet in OBS itself)** (Tools → Scripts; Lua needs nothing installed): finds
     Lockpick's API address and token itself, adds the Lockpick sources (and a Game Capture of the game) to a
     scene, and automates runs through OBS's own frontend API — start/stop recording with a run, chapter markers
     at splits, fails and deaths, save the replay buffer on a death, a fail or a new best, switch to a "paused"
     scene while the game is inactive or minimized and back. It reads Lockpick's events from a local file
     (OBS Lua has no network), so no WebSocket password is involved; browser pages that need OBS access get the
     lowest control level that works (4 for scenes and replays);
   - the docs recommend Game Capture (works in every mode, 640×480 native, no pillarbox).
5. **Training captures — built 2026-10-16 (#61; a live capture and the dataset check to go):** opt-in, every game frame (the in-game clock's ticks): state, the held and new input words
   and the raw pad word, control type, room and camera, enemies; a consent screen (what is recorded, nothing
   personal); submitted like play captures; checked by `tools/rl/dataset.py` and a small behaviour-cloning model
   (dev). Optional pairing with an OBS recording (its start time and chapters) for models that learn from video.
   Needs every input setup recorded (B207).
6. **Ready for other players:** **Done 2026-10-16 (#62, #63):** the player guide (docs/GUIDE.md), streamer mode, the
   support bundle and error reports, the window remembered per monitor setup. **Still open:** code signing (owner's
   decision) and the frame-pacing check with OBS (B209). The plan: a player guide (install, challenges, cheats, overlay, OBS, LiveSplit, captures);
   streamer mode (hides profile paths, process ids and the API token on screen); a one-click support bundle;
   unexpected errors logged with an offer to send the bundle; the Lockpick window remembers its size per monitor;
   code signing so Windows stops warning about the installer (owner decision: certificate or Azure Trusted Signing);
   OBS + Lockpick + the game together checked for frame pacing (B209).

### 0.3.1 — OBS automation and keep-running

- **OBS WebSocket (optional, for setups the script can't cover, e.g. OBS on another PC; the password kept with
  Windows DPAPI):** the same automation as `lockpick.lua` from Lockpick's side — scene setup, recording with runs,
  chapters (`CreateRecordChapter`), replay buffer, the "paused" scene.
- **Keep the game running when it isn't the active window** (opt-in, Trainer Mode only, never in challenges; the
  in-process focus patch `0x44126B`, MEMORY_MAP "Focus and input"; chosen by the owner 2026-10-13) — the alternative
  to the OBS "paused" scene for people who aren't running a challenge.

Known HUD data (already understood, read-only) for sprint 2 and #42:
- HP status as the game rates it — Jill Fine 73–96 / Caution 25–48 / Danger 0–24, Chris 106 / 36 / 0
  thresholds (speedrun damage chart, matches the GOG build);
- poisoned indicator (status byte `0xBE63C0` bit `0x02`, Yawn's poison `0x20`; −2 HP each time the timer
  `0xBE6458` runs out, ~4 s) and the status screen's own HP band (`0xAE9F2F`) — runtime-verified 2026-10-14;
- enemy health in the current room (enemy slots: type, HP, active);
- what just happened: an event feed in plain words (picked up the Emblem, Zombie ankle bite (6), first visit to
  room 11D, Barry gives Jill the lockpick) — the capture timeline's logic in the app (#43);
- current room and area by name (areas from the game's room table; names as they are confirmed);
- room map — in the app since 2026-10-14 (`Re1RoomMaps`, `RoomMapControl`); next: script-placed objects (the
  dining-room clock) and the whole-floor view (tools/rdt/floor_map.py), then an overlay / browser-source version.

## Developer tooling (never shipped)

Automated play is for the owner's development and testing only — never in the app, its installer or a release:
players play the game themselves; Lockpick enhances their play.

- **Automated testing harness** (`tools/Lockpick.Autoplay` + `tools/autoplay`, 2026-10-14) — **working:**
  - virtual Xbox 360 controller (ViGEmBus); menus driven by a local vision model's screen labels; new games for
    either character;
  - **enter any room** through a real door record (the game's own door handoff, fade and arrival spot);
  - **fast-forward cutscenes** (tick interval; every effect kept); control detected from the state flags;
  - **stand at a spot** (e.g. an item's pickup zone) and **heal**; read-only `peek`; captures of whole runs;
  - `scene.py <character> <room>`: load a practice save at the right story stage, then enter the room — any part of
    the game with either character.
- **First overnight run (2026-10-14):** every door-reachable room entered from a new game for both characters (162
  of 165 door targets each; the other 3 are stub room files that crash the game), phase surveys from practice saves
  (guardhouse 35, return mansion 58, caves 17, lab 22 rooms — all entered, both characters; 588 room visits in all),
  and 75 saves loaded with Lockpick's live room/character matching the offline save decode (73 of 75; the other two,
  a pair of practice saves at the same spot in 513 with camera 5, crash the game on load even at normal speed). Results, captures and an atlas stay local (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Lockpick\research\night-20261014`).
- **Item pickup verification (2026-10-14):** every armed item zone of a new game, both characters: 295 items picked up (Jill 138, Chris 157), each giving the item and clearing the flag the room index names; the only differences are 104/604's two clips stacked on one spot and 719's battery hand-over spot next to its rounds — both in the room scripts. Not-yet-placed items (story-gated), event hand-overs and unreachable spots are listed per room.
- Next: regression scripts (expected flags/items per scene, run after changes to addresses or event rules), item
  pickups at their zones (camera re-cut after placement), capture bounties that need precise actions, why the first
  door handoff after a save load is ignored.
- Unattended runs — **done 2026-10-14:** `--background` applies the focus patch inside the harness (dev runs only)
  and blanks the keyboard map; the game ran, read the virtual pad and rendered behind other windows. Memory input
  (`0x497BF7`) isn't needed for testing. During runs `SAVE/*.dat` are read-only and hash-checked after every step.
- Vision labels — **working 2026-10-14:** describes screenshots and labels menus; not reliable for reading the
  status screen (invents item lists), so item names were checked against the game's own name table instead.

## 0.4.0 — World database

- RDT parser for the user's own installation (no assets redistributed): cameras, doors (`door_aot_set`),
  items (`item_aot_set`), enemies (`SceEmSet`). **Done as a research tool** (`tools/rdt`, every retail room file,
  committed as `room-index.json` with ids and numbers only); still to do: port to C# for in-app use, and cameras.
- **Event-script parser** (RDT `offsets[8]`): cutscene scripts set the story flags room scripts don't, hand over items
  (Barry's lockpick, Richard's radio) and play voice lines — parsing them names events without asking and tells the
  subtitles which line plays when.
- Room/camera names database in `data/games/re1/` (JSON), keyed by room id — areas done (`rooms.json`), names so far
  for rooms identified in play; the rest via ask mode / community.
- Rooms-visited and map/document flags: done (the game's table at `0x4D31E0`; maps = item + 46, documents = item + 35).
- Enemy array reader (30 × 0x18C at `0xBE6464`) runtime-verified — types, HP and active flag behave as expected in
  every capture (static anchor still needed); most enemy types identified in play.
- On-screen text: which message is shown (pointer at `0xD226A4`, text buffer recorded in captures) and the room files'
  MSG section decoded locally — for a text log and examine/pickup messages.

## 0.5.0 — Highlighting and ESP

- World-to-screen projection using RDT camera data; overlay markers for items, doors, enemies.

## 0.6.0 — Advanced trainer

- Teleport, movement speed, enemy freeze/health, event-flag editor, game speed.
- The event-flag editor shows the named flags (story, puzzles, locks, items, rooms) instead of raw bits, with
  story-state presets ("start at the courtyard").
- Give or remove any item; put pickups back into the world (set their pickup bit), reset puzzles (clear their named
  flags), respawn enemies (clear kill flags), reset the map's explored rooms; teleport (room + position).
- Challenge setups (knife-only, no herbs, start with nothing) and a light item randomizer, built on the same writes.
- **Save tools** (moved from 0.2.0; write only save files, never the process; always a backup first and an exact
  restore, never in Challenge Mode): save reader (done as `tools/bounties/saves.py`: a save is a copy of the state
  block — offset + `0xBE9620`), a **scene library / practice mode** (put any practice save into a spare slot: Plant
  42, Lab Tyrant, Rebecca…), and a **save editor** (inventory, item box, story flags) once it is known whether saves
  carry a checksum.

## 0.7.0 — Contextual guidance

- Missed-item warnings, puzzle-state tracking, route guidance, warnings under 100 ms.
- **Progress tracker** (read-only, Challenge-safe — can ship before 0.7, it needs no new memory research): per room
  and area, items still there vs taken (room index + item flags), documents and maps collected, rooms explored (the
  map's own flags), enemies killed for good, and story/puzzle progress from the named flags.
- Timed events: countdowns the game keeps silently (Richard's serum errand, 15 min; later the self-destruct).
- Missed-item warning when leaving a room or area with items left (from the same data).

## Event candidates found in live traces

- ~~`GameLoaded` / new game~~ — implemented (timer discontinuities), tested against both live fixtures.
- Worked out in the research tools (timeline / ask mode), to move into the app's `EventDetector`: item picked up,
  put back, used, received, combined, loaded; document/map taken; first visit to a room; door/desk unlocked; enemy
  killed (kill flags) and getting back up; attack by name (damage per hit); poison ticks; object pushed; named story
  and puzzle events.
- `PlayerDied`: `stateFlags & 0x01000000` with HP ≤ 0 — needs a gated raw-field path.
- `GameSaved`: from the save files (#37); ink ribbon use is visible in the inventory (Chris).

## 0.8.0 — Speedrun and challenges

- Run timer, LiveSplit, autosplits, run records, deaths and the no-damage / knife-only rules move to 0.3.0 (their
  capture bounties B701–B704, B706 too). Here: PB history and run review, more challenge rules (no heal, no saves,
  deathless…), community segment templates, trainer-modification records (records, not anti-cheat claims).
- Voice-over subtitles (moved from 0.3.0): optional download of the separate
  [lockpick-subtitles](https://github.com/mscrnt/lockpick-subtitles) pack (off by default; checked against the
  player's voice files by SHA-256), shown in the overlay while a line plays. Needs: which voice file is playing.
- Autosplits from the named story flags and room transitions, matching the community's segment templates (Yawn 1,
  Mansion 1, Courtyard 1, … End — speedrun.com); in-game time from the game timer; the capture timeline as a run
  review (where time went, damage taken, items used).

## 0.9.0 — Optional AI, performance, compatibility

- Optional ONNX inference (< 200 ms, CPU fallback) only where deterministic data is unavailable.
- Additional builds (other GOG revisions, languages) as fingerprinted profiles.
- Community labelling: ask-mode answers and `auto` markers from submitted captures become suggested flag labels
  (reviewed before merging), like the bounty automation does for evidence.

## 1.0.0 — Stable RE1

- All features verified on supported builds; documentation complete; signed releases.

## Backlog / ideas

- "Compact" always-on-top mode for a side screen (remembering the window size per monitor is in 0.3.0 sprint 6).
- ~~Music track lead (`0xD226A0`)~~ — ruled out 2026-10-14 (a sound-state bitfield, not a track id; MEMORY_MAP Leads).
- Ask mode with a controller button instead of the keyboard (the owner plays with a DualSense).
- Investigate why the game window cannot be dragged (window style `0x14C80000` has a caption; the 1997 window procedure likely swallows the move).
